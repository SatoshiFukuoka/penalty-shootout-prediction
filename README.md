# Penalty Shootout Prediction

## Introduction
this is a CNN classifier to predict where the ball will go before the kicker's contact with the ball with a single image. It was hard to find high resolution images of real players. Therefore, I decided to collect and create my own dataset using FIFA 18.

## Quick Start
1. Download the custom dataset [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0aXfoB5dWNBcomUI-EitTZeS9tWMh-2/view?usp=sharing)
2. Download the pre-trained model [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYG2KSVlcjiqz1O4kkVm36OTT_245HB0/view?usp=sharing)
3. Run `python inference.py` once you place images you want to test in `./data/test/`
